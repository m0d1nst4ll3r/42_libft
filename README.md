# 42_libft

Todo:

1. Finish all functions (stopped at itoa, list functions remaining)
2. Go back and rewrite funcs to reuse existing functions where possible (makes more sense)
3. Write custom bonus funcs like strndup, use them in strsplit and the such
4. Fix NULL and similar inconsistencies so that the code is more pleasing to look at
5. Write a main to test everything
