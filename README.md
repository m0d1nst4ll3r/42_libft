# 42_libft

The project will be turned in without any custom bonus function.
These (with their corresponding header and Makefile) will stay in the custom folder of this project, to be used later in the real libft.

Todo:

1. Use the 2 following tests

	https://github.com/alelievr/libft-unit-test

	https://github.com/Tripouille/libftTester

2. Finish writing the main to test everything
	/!\ The main was started using the old pdf, some functions have been removed and others added
3. Do a last double check on file names in headers, static funcs, etc...

Note:

Makefile 'bonus' rule is bugged and relinks every time.
I haven't found a way to do it right. Makefiles are weird.
I give up.
