# 42_libft

The project will be turned in without any custom bonus function.
These (with their corresponding header and Makefile) will stay in the custom folder of this project, to be used later in the real libft.

Todo:

1. Fix Makefile bonus bug
2. Use the 3 following tests (one or two may be out of date)
	https://github.com/ska42/libft-war-machine
	https://github.com/alelievr/libft-unit-test
	https://github.com/Tripouille/libftTester
3. Finish writing the main to test everything
	/!\ The main was started using the old pdf, some functions have been removed and others added
4. Do a last double check on file names in headers, static funcs, etc...
